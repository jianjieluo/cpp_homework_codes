Tips(pseudo code):
remember, you need to realize adaptor as the following way!
# b = the digits of numeric_limits<double>
# r = generator.max - generator.min + 1
# log2r = log(r) / log(2)
# k = max(1, (b + log2r - 1) / log2r)
# sum = 0 and tmp = 1
# loop k -> 0
# sum += (generator.randomNumber - generator.min) * tmp
# tmp = tmp * r
# end loop
# return sum / tmp
