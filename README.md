# cpp_homework_code
Just put all of my cpp homework code from 2015 to 2016.

After a term learning, as a programming beginer, I am happy that I have done these exercises and so I just want to store them
on the github for memory.

Maybe I will forget the problems description in the future, but I think that maybe I will use some algorithm and some data
structures in the files in the future.

I will also try to review my code in my spare time and try to simplify my original code for more efficiency. :)
